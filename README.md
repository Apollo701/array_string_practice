# array_string_practice
Practicing with arrays and strings

Solving questions such as:

unique_strings.rb: implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

string_permutation.rb: given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other

string_to_ascii.rb: write a method to replace all spaces in a string with a '%20'

string_compression.rb: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
EX: aabcccccaaa => a2b1c5a3. If original string is unique, just outputs the original string.

zero_out_matrix.rb: Algorithm such taht if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0

string_rotation_check.rb: Use method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings,
s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using one call to isSubstring (e.g.,"waterbottle is a rotation
of "erbottlewat").
